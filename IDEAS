* actual files must be separated into directories with names starting
  on first symbols of md5 or something like this to escape the problem
  with too long search for file by its md5 in fuuge directory;
* some trick may be also required for the too large sqlite databases;
* add special condition commands for reveal/create/alias like one
  which shows only files changed in last N minutes
* tone-server must be used in form of:

  $ tone clone <addr>    # here only control data is cloned.
                         # Key --all makes download all data from server
  $ tone reveal <tag-expr>   # if repo is cloned and needed tags are not present
                             # on this machene will try to be downloaded from repo.
* make possibility to use utility with plugins (like for downloading
  wallpapers of certain tag) without actual tone-repo creation (for
  those who doesn not intend to use this system by it's primary
  function
* journal for actiona performed. Binary changes will be too large so
  it may be simply notes like "added file FILENAME to tag TAGNAME"
  etc. Must be optional.
