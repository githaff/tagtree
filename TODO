* add test for initializing on unsupported FS (which doesn't have hard
  links);
* implement plugins framework;
* perfomance tests on LARGE amount of tags (+comparison with other
  tagging software, particulary with FUSE-based like tagsistant);
* think through case of identical files in different tags. When one is
  changed the other also will be changed (if tone is already
  updated). Anyway right after copying file to another location it may
  be changed before tagging... need to pay attention;
